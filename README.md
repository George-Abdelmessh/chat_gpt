# Chat GPT Application

ChatGPT is a large language model created by OpenAI that is based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It is designed to process and generate natural language text, enabling it to engage in conversations with humans in a way that feels natural and responsive.

The ChatGPT project involved training the model on an enormous amount of text data, including books, articles, and websites. This allowed the model to learn patterns and relationships in language, and to develop an understanding of the nuances of human communication.
